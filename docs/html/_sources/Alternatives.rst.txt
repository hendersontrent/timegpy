Alternative software libraries
==============================

``timegpy`` was developed for the specific use case of finding time-average features for time-series classification settings. This bespoke software package was built as the input data structure and fitness requirements of temporal data are quite different from the usual inputs to a genetic programming package. This means that compared to existing software, ``timegpy`` is not as well tested or implemented, although it means there is no burden on the user to configure an existing library to a time-series feature context. We provide links to some excellent and well tested alternative libraries for performing genetic programming below:

* `SymbolicRegression.jl <https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl>`_
* `gplearn <https://gplearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
* `GP-GOMEA <https://github.com/marcovirgolin/GP-GOMEA>`_
